Cataracts are a leading cause of blindness. IRIS, an AI-powered detection system, uses deep learning to analyze retinal fundus images, classifying them as normal or cataractous. It aims to improve early detection, accessibility, and diagnosis objectivity, reducing costs and enhancing eye health outcomes through timely intervention.
