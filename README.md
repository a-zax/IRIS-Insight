# IRIS-Insight
Cataracts represent a significant global health challenge, being a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Early detection and treatment are crucial for preventing long-term visual impairment, yet access to skilled healthcare professionals for screening and diagnosis can be limited in resource-constrained environments. This project introduces IRIS, an innovative eye disease detection system empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), specifically utilizing deep learning techniques for the analysis of retinal fundus images. IRIS aims to revolutionize the approach to cataract detection by automating the classification of fundus images into two categories: normal and cataractous. By leveraging the capabilities of AI, IRIS offers potential improvements in early detection, increased accessibility of screening services, cost reduction, and enhanced objectivity in diagnosis. The ultimate goal of this project is to facilitate timely intervention and improve eye health outcomes through the development of an accurate, efficient, and accessible diagnostic tool. This paper outlines the methodology, benefits, and aims of utilizing deep learning for cataract detection, underscoring its potential to transform eye care services and support healthcare professionals in the fight against vision loss due to cataracts.
